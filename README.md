# Violet Starter Kit

The Violet Starter Kit includes a couple of [images](./images) for you to use in your simulations.
In addition, it includes a [template](./flocking.py) which you can use to build the flocking simulation.

Simply click on the shiny green `Use this template` button at the top of this page to create your own GitHub repository.
From there, [clone your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) with either:
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) (recommended)
- [The GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)
- or manually with the `git clone` command

## Getting Started

[Violet](https://github.com/m-rots/violet) is built on top of the latest and greatest Python features such as type hints, generics and dataclasses.
Therefore, you need to have the latest version of Python installed: Python 3.13 or later.

The easiest way of installing the latest version of Python, as well as creating a virtual environment, is by installing [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Once installed, simply run the following command to run the code:

```sh
uv run flocking.py
```
